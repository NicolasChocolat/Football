### Countries screen

I use an array called 'countries' from the field data so I can get all the countries to use them to get the league by Countrie.

For this I use an API called  API-FOOTBALL.
I fetch from the API and did a GET method to have all leagues from a country.

After I choose the season, the user can choose the season by writting on the inpuld field.

After he clicked on the button, you navigate to the next page called "Clubs".

____
### Clubs screen


The screen Clubs shows all the club from the country selected from the previous page.
I fetch the clubs with the API.

The user can choose each club and clicked on the button "Search player". He will go to the next screen and get all the players from the club.

___
### Players screen && Player Screen
He can click on the button "See more details" to get statistics from a player from a season.I get the firstname,familyname, height and weight from the API.
For each player, there is a button "See more details". When pressed the user can go to the next page and see statistics from the player.
It gives us all the statistics from the season choosen on the countries screen.
